# Reading multiple accelerometers in Arduino

This repository shows how to read two MPU6050 accelerometers in Arduino and display their readings with a Processing Sketch.

Please watch the Youtube video of the demo here:

## How to run

You have to change the address of one of the accelerometers by using the AD0 pin on the accelerometer. When you have both accelerometers connected to the I2C (please check the Arduino sketch for the pinout), flash the Arduino, open the Processing sketch and modify the Serial port address there. Then launch the Processing sketch and you should get the output visualized!
